Muni_Payroll_Explorer
=====================

This is a web application made with the R framework, shiny.  It was designed to explore the salary and benefit costs of employees working for the Municipality of Anchorage.  This topic became especially hot when Anchorage Ordinance 37 was passed and its repeal was brought before voters for the November 2014 ballot. 

The creator of this web application is only interested in presenting the data and has no interest in presenting an argument for support or repeal of AO37.
